Automatically switch between light and dark system themes on sunrise and sunset.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

As of today, Nightcall only works with macOS. Standalone installation will make most sense with Mojave (or newer) as this is the first version to have a proper dark OS theme.

### Installing

Just run:

```sh
yarn global add nightcall
```
or:
```sh
npm i -g nightcall
```

Nightcall will be installed globally and automatic setup will follow right after installation.

There is a [Nightcall (VS Code)](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=witalewski.nightcall-vs-code) extension available to switch between dark and light themes in VS Code in sync with Nightcall.

## Running the tests

To run tests locally, go to the module directory and execute `yarn run jest`
